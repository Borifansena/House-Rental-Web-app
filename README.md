## Description

"# House Rental Web App - NestJS Backend with MongoDB

This project aims to create a web application for house rentals. We have chosen to use MongoDB as the database for our NestJS backend due to its flexibility and suitability for our project idea.

Why MongoDB?
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database known for its scalability and flexible document-oriented data model. It allows us to store and manage complex data structures with ease, making it a great fit for our house rental web app.

Here are some reasons why we chose MongoDB:

Flexibility: MongoDB's document-based model allows us to store data in a way that reflects the structure of our application. We can easily adapt and modify the data schema as our project evolves.

Scalability: MongoDB's horizontal scaling capabilities enable us to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads. This ensures that our web app can grow seamlessly as the number of users and rental listings increases.

Performance: MongoDB is designed for high-performance data retrieval and querying. It supports powerful indexing and aggregation features, which will help us optimize our queries and deliver fast responses to users.

Integration with NestJS: MongoDB has excellent support within the NestJS ecosystem. There are robust libraries and plugins available that make it easy to connect, interact, and perform CRUD operations with the database in our NestJS backend.

Project Overview
Our house rental web app will provide a platform for users to browse and search for rental properties. They can view property details, check availability, and contact the property owners for inquiries. The backend built with NestJS and MongoDB will handle user authentication, property management, and communication between users and property owners.
